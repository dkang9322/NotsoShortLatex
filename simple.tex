Small is beautiful

%Example1 and purposefully using a paragraph break
\ldots when Einstein %
introduced his formula
\begin{equation}
  e = m \cdot c^2 \; , %What does a semicolon mean? -> gives a little bit of space
\end{equation}

which is at the same time the %
most widely known and the least well understood physical formula.

%Example 2; again we don't want to use \\, but rather have an empty line for a new paragraph
\ldots from which follows Kirchoff's current law:
\begin{equation}
  \sum_{k=1}^{n} I_k = 0 \; .
\end{equation}

% a purposeful Paragraph indentation
Kirchoff's voltage law can be derived \ldots

%Example 3; again, a paragraph break. Note it's easy to introduce paragraph breaks unknowingly.
\ldots which has several advantages.

% Purposeful paragraph break
\begin{equation}
  I_D =I_F - I_R
\end{equation}
is the core of a very differnt transistor model. \ldots

% Paragrmpah break
\ldots quotation checkin ``hello `world'''
\begin{comment}
Finally understood difference between a blank line between texts vs
\\:

1. a blank line between texts makes a new paragraph (indented on left)
2. a \\ simply is MY specification of cutting of the current paragraph (no indentation on left for the new line)
